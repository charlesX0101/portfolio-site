        <p>
          I'm <strong>Charles</strong>, an IT Systems Specialist with more than ten years of experience in troubleshooting, managing endpoints, and providing hands-on support for macOS, iOS, Linux, and cloud-integrated environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          After years in busy support roles, including retail IT and device repair, I started to focus on system architecture, cybersecurity, and automation. Now, I share my labs, tools, and learning publicly to stay sharp and accountable.
        </p>
        <p>
          My workflow relies on the command line, shell scripting, and layered security practices. I think it's important to learn by doing. Building a professional identity comes from demonstrating your work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I created this site to bring together my technical documentation, projects, and personal setup in one spot. Everything here shows actual builds, actual systems, and actual progress.
        </p>

  <li>ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity Specialization</li>
  <li>Google Cybersecurity Specialization</li>
  <li>Learn Quest Linux Fundamentals</li>
  <li>Coursera AWS Fundamentals Specialization</li>
</ul>

<h3>[/Skills & Focus]</h3>

<h3>[/Philosophy]</h3>
<p>
  I believe in simplicity, clarity, and practical use. I document everything I build, not because it's perfect, but because it's real. Every script here was created to solve a specific problem. If it helped me, maybe it will help someone else too.
</p>

<h3>[/Other Interests]</h3>
<p>
  Outside of work, I enjoy retro gaming, scripting for emulators, and working with digital audio. If it’s technical and worth doing by hand, it likely appears here.
