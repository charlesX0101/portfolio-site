# charlesx0101.com

A clean, terminal-inspired personal website built with HTML and CSS.

This project is a hand-coded portfolio site that reflects my style, background, and technical projects. It's intentionally minimal, accessible, and fast. The design takes inspiration from the command line and text-based interfaces, avoiding unnecessary frameworks or JavaScript.

## Pages

- **Homepage** — brief intro and navigation
- **About** — a short overview of who I am and what I care about
- **Labs** — walkthroughs, technical experiments, and write-ups
- **Projects** — selected tools, scripts, and systems I've built
- **Contact** — how to reach me or check out my work

## Features

- No JavaScript or libraries
- Fully responsive (desktop and mobile)
- Semantic HTML and organized CSS
- CLI-themed styling with monospace typography
- GitHub Pages compatible
